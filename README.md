<h2>Known issues and upcoming changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Alaska is missing! ALaska data was weird because its counties change often.</li>
  <li>Mobile does not look great.</li>
  <li>On rare occasions, it will mark your guess wrong when it's actually right. </li>
  <li>Guesses are sometimes too easy - randomizer is OK not great.</li>
</ul>
